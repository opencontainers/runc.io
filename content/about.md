## About

runC is the canonical implementation of a container runtime that implements the [Open Container Initiative's][oci] runtime specification.
It was originally donated by Docker in the form of `libcontainer`, and is now maintained by various individuals from different companies and interests.
runC is currently the standard container runtime used by the Docker engine, and is slowly being integrated into other projects.

The OCI is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtime.
Projects associated to the Open Container Initiative can be found at [https://github.com/opencontainers](https://github.com/opencontainers).
There are more details about connecting with the OCI community [here][oci-community] and [here][oci-contact].
